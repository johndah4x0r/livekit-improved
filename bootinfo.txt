Thanks for using mylinux!
Steps to make it bootable from your USB device:

1) Extract the contents of ZIP archive to your USB drive.
   If you are using Windows, you will get for example E:\mylinux\
   You probably already did this, just make sure you extracted
   the archive to your USB drive and not to your local hard disk.

2) Now navigate to directory /mylinux/boot/ on your USB drive.
   In Windows, it will be for example: E:\mylinux\boot\
   Use Windows Explorer or any other file manager for this task.

3) While you're in the boot directory, locate file BootInstall.bat (or .sh)
   Run it by double-clicking it. It will setup your USB to boot.

-- That's it. Your USB device is now ready to boot mylinux.
-- You can safely delete this file (mylinux.txt), it's not needed.
