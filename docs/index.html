    <h3>Tell me about this stuff:</h2>
    <pre id="info">
Live Kit Improved is a whole new rewrite of the original
Linux Live Kit used in both Slax and Porteus.
    
New features and functionality is included, which is
really unique to Live Kit Improved.

And the best thing is;
You don't need to be that tech-savvy to use
this stuff! It is easy to use!
    </pre>

    <h3>What can it do? Are you just adding bells and whistles?</h3>
    <p>It can do more than you think! And nope, not just that!</p>
    <h3>Well, show me the advantages!</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <p>Better bootup sequence.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <p>More user-friendly.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <p>More functionality, thus more versatile, right... Uhmmm, anyone?!?</p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <p>Has the option to change between AUFS and OverlayFS without a hassle! (good luck!)</p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <p>The best of all; It's open source!</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
